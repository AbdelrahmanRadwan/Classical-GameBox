# Classical Game-Box!

![Example 1](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanRadwan/Classical-GameBox/blob/master/results/1.png  "Example 1")

### A GameBox made in SFML using C++, It consists of two games:

1. the very famous pack-man game: A game in which you are playing with that yellow creature trying to eat that points, and that monsters are trying to eat you.

2. the very famous Bomber-man: A game in which you are playing with that white hero, and you are trying to bomb all the blocks to find the port to win.

SFML will not give you a lot of advanced options like XNA (Using C#), but that is not a very bad thing! that’s a great opportunity to release your creativity, problem solving, and how-to-do skills.

For example, I made a menu, although SFML doesn't give you the ability to add menu, but using some pictures which will be changed if you pressed some keyboard keys, I could actually create one!

Some of magic things I could do is that, the places of monsters and blocks are generated randomly in bomber-man, it’s a very eay trick, just use the generate random function of c++ (built in function) but not on numbers, on positions of blocks.
